# Semantic-ID

Semantic ID Generation based on RQ-VAE Architecture for Recommendation purposes based on the presented architecture in "Recommender Systems with Generative Retrieval" by Rajput S. et al. and "Better Generalization with Semantic IDs: A Case Study in Ranking for Recommendations" by Singh A. et al..

The items in the corpus are mapped to a tuple set of semantic IDs by trraing an RQ-VAE, see Figure below.
